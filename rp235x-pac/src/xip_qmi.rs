#[doc = "ATRANS1 (rw) register accessor: Configure address translation for XIP virtual addresses 0x400000 through 0x7fffff (a 4 MiB window starting at +4 MiB).  

 Address translation allows a program image to be executed in place at multiple physical flash addresses (for example, a double-buffered flash image for over-the-air updates), without the overhead of position-independent code.  

 At reset, the address translation registers are initialised to an identity mapping, so that they can be ignored if address translation is not required.  

 Note that the XIP cache is fully virtually addressed, so a cache flush is required after changing the address translation.
