#[doc = "This register controls the power state of the 4 power domains.  
 The current power state is indicated in POWMAN_STATE_CURRENT which is read-only.  
 To change the state, write to POWMAN_STATE_REQ.  
 The coding of POWMAN_STATE_CURRENT &amp; POWMAN_STATE_REQ corresponds to the power states  
 defined in the datasheet:  
 bit 3 = SWCORE  
 bit 2 = XIP cache  
 bit 1 = SRAM0  
 bit 0 = SRAM1  
 0 = powered up  
 1 = powered down  
 When POWMAN_STATE_REQ is written, the POWMAN_STATE_WAITING flag is set while the Power Manager determines what is required. If an invalid transition is requested the Power Manager will still register the request in POWMAN_STATE_REQ but will also set the POWMAN_BAD_REQ flag. It will then implement the power-up requests and ignore the power down requests. To do nothing would risk entering an unrecoverable lock-up state. Invalid requests are: any combination of power up and power down requests any request that results in swcore boing powered and xip unpowered If the request is to power down the switched-core domain then POWMAN_STATE_WAITING stays active until the processors halt. During this time the POWMAN_STATE_REQ field can be re-written to change or cancel the request. When the power state transition begins the POWMAN_STATE_WAITING_flag is cleared, the POWMAN_STATE_CHANGING flag is set and POWMAN register writes are ignored until the transition completes.
