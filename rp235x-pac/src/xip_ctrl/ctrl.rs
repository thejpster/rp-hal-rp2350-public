 Second, when a written line is evicted, it will cause a write command to be issued to the flash, which can break the flash out of its continuous read mode. After this point, flash reads will return garbage. This is a security concern, as it allows NonSecure software to break Secure flash reads if it has permission to write to any flash address.  

 Note the read-only behaviour is implemented by downgrading writes to reads, so writes will still cause allocation of an address, but have no other effect."]
