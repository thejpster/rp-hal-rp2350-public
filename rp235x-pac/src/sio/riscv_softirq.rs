 Unlike the RISC-V timer, this interrupt is not routed to a normal system-level interrupt line, so can not be used by the Arm cores.  

 It is safe for both cores to write to this register on the same cycle. The set/clear effect is accumulated across both cores, and then applied. If a flag is both set and cleared on the same cycle, only the set takes effect.  

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`riscv_softirq::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`riscv_softirq::W`](W).
