The entries are either _VALUEs where the 16 bit value is used as is, or _STRDEFs which acts as a pointers to a string value. The value stored in a _STRDEF is two separate bytes: The low seven bits of the first (LSB) byte indicates the number of characters in the string, and the top bit of the first (LSB) byte if set to indicate that each character in the string is two bytes (Unicode) versus one byte if unset. The second (MSB) byte represents the location of the string data, and is encoded as the number of rows from this USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR; i.e. the row of the start of the string is USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR value + msb_byte. In each case, the corresponding valid bit enables replacing the default value for the corresponding item provided by the boot rom. Note that Unicode _STRDEFs are only supported for USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT_STRDEF, USB_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER_STRDEF and USB_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER_STRDEF. Unicode values will be ignored if specified for other fields, and non-unicode values for these three items will be converted to Unicode characters by setting the upper 8 bits to zero.
